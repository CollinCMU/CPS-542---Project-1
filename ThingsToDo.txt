Hello Team,

I created this file to help keep track of what still needs to be worked on.


Things that are DONE
=======================
-Read in points from points.txt
-Sorting algorithm
-Brute Force algorithm


Things to do
=======================
-Write the efficientClosestPair algorithm in ClosestPair.java
--should run in theta(n log n) time
--pseudo-code is available on BlackBoard under "Notes -> Efficient Closest Pairs"


-Make sure everything is properly commented according to the JavaDoc sheet on blackboard
