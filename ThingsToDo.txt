Hello Team,

I created this file to help keep track of what still needs to be worked on.


Things to do
=================
-Write a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm in ClosestPair.java 
--Must run in theta(n log n) time
--Collin is now working on this. I'm going to implement mergesort as it runs in theta(n log n)


-Write the efficientClosestPair algorithm in ClosestPair.java
--should run in theta(n log n) time
--pseudo-code is available on BlackBoard under "Notes -> Efficient Closest Pairs"

-Write the bruteClosestPair algorithm in ClosestPair.java
--should run in theta(n^2) time
--pseudo-code is available on BlackBoard under "Notes -> Efficient Closest Pairs"
