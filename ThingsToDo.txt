Hello Team,

I created this file to help keep track of what still needs to be worked on.


Things that are done
=======================
-Read in points from points.txt
-Sorting algorithm



Things to do
=======================
-Add better comments to sorting methods (Collin will do this)


- Tried to do efficientClosestPair and bruteClosestPair see if it has any errors (by Rasi to Team)

-Write the efficientClosestPair algorithm in ClosestPair.java
--should run in theta(n log n) time
--pseudo-code is available on BlackBoard under "Notes -> Efficient Closest Pairs"- Rasi is working on this

-Write the bruteClosestPair algorithm in ClosestPair.java
--should run in theta(n^2) time
--pseudo-code is available on BlackBoard under "Notes -> Efficient Closest Pairs"
--Rasi is working on this 

-Make sure everything is properly commented according to the JavaDoc sheet on blackboard
